# Object Orientation with Java Class Project
#### A calendar app that helps appointment hosts connect with thier attendees.

This Calendar app functions very similarly to Calendly online. The user can log into either log into their host account, attendee
account, or register a new account if they wish. Logging on as a host allows the user to set up their appointment availability and view details
about who has made an appointment with them and when. Going in as an attendee allows the user to search for a host using their username,
and selecting the date that they want to reserve. Appointments are viewed and created through an interactive calendar. The app currently does
not account for leap years.

This project was created solely in Java in order that we apply software engineering concepts and design patterns. For example, the project
applies abstract classes, Java Persistence, interfaces, enumerators, static utility classes, Java collections, inheritance, and encapsulation.
Java swing was used to create all GUI elements, and, as JDBC was more advanced, the project used three CSV files to store data, which was loaded
into a 'Database' class upon running the app. Major challenges were displaying the correct calendar for each month and loading data from files
into their respective Java collections.

Future Improvemts:
- Add functionality for specifying a time for every appointment
- Allow host users to interact with their calendar to view details about each appointment
- Implement a list of upcoming and past appointments within one week, for both host and attendee accounts
- More color to the GUI
- Configurability settings for GUI and other app functions
